            , a pioneer in computer science and a United States Navy rear
            admiral, revolutionized the world of programming and computing. She
            was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer and
            developed the first compiler, which led to the creation of COBOL—a
            programming language still in use today.
            <br />
            <br />
            Her groundbreaking work has shaped the way modern computers operate
            and influenced generations of computer scientists.

          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Born in 1906 in New York City, Grace Brewster Murray Hopper
            displayed an early talent for mathematics and problem-solving.
            <br />
            <br />After earning her Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University,
            she began her teaching career at Vassar College. However, with the
            outbreak of World War II, she left academia to join the Navy, where
            her journey into computer science began.

          <h2>The Mark I and the First Compiler</h2>
          <p>
            In 1944, Hopper was assigned to work on the Harvard Mark I, one of
            the earliest electro-mechanical computers. As a member of the
            programming team, she contributed to calculations for crucial
            wartime efforts. Later, she went on to create the first compiler,
            A-0, which translated human-readable instructions into machine code.
            <br />
            <br />
            This invention transformed programming, enabling the creation of
            more complex programs without the need for hardware-level
            manipulation.

          <h2>The Birth of COBOL</h2>
          <p>
            Grace Hopper's most famous legacy is COBOL (Common Business-Oriented
            Language), developed in the 1950s. Hopper believed that programming
            languages should be as close to human language as possible, allowing
            people to "talk" to machines. COBOL was designed to be readable by
            people with little technical training and remains one of the most
            widely used programming languages in business today.

        <section id="bug">
          <h2>Debugging and the First "Computer Bug"</h2>
          <p>
            Grace Hopper is also credited with popularizing the term "debugging"
            in computing. While working on the Mark II computer in 1947, her
            team discovered a moth trapped in one of the machine’s relays,
            causing a malfunction. Although the term "bug" had been used in
            engineering before, Hopper humorously recorded the incident, making
            it famous in the context of computing.
          </p>

        <section id="legacy">
          <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
          <p>
            Grace Hopper retired from the Navy at the age of 79 as a rear
            admiral, having spent decades at the forefront of computer
            technology. Even in retirement, she continued to lecture and inspire
            new generations of tech enthusiasts. The annual Grace Hopper
            Celebration, the world’s largest gathering of women in computing,
            carries on her mission to break down barriers and promote diversity
            in technology.
            <br />
            <br />
            Her innovations—compilers, programming languages, and her vision of
            computers serving humanity—have permanently shaped modern computing.
